I created a Chrome extension that can helps data entry enter data faster. This is a simple version that demonstrates the basic features, including:

1️⃣ Verifying the accuracy of national ID numbers, which reduces the time spent double-checking.

2️⃣ Retrieving district and province data from chrome.storage.local when inputting sub-district data.

3️⃣ Importing and exporting JSON files for later use.

This extension has been a big help for me and my coworker in performing mundane tasks. It can reduce the time required around 20% per document! 😊!
