I created a Chrome extension that can helps data entry enter data faster. This is a simple version that demonstrates the basic features, including:

1️⃣ Verifying the accuracy of national ID numbers, which reduces the time spent double-checking.

2️⃣ Retrieving district and province data from chrome.storage.local when inputting sub-district data.

3️⃣ Importing and exporting JSON files for later use.

This extension has been a big help for me and my coworker in performing mundane tasks. It can reduce the time required around 20% per document! 😊!

If you're interested in trying out my Chrome extension, feel free to test it out and clone the Git repo or download the code to try it for yourself.
I welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have, so don't hesitate to reach out to me. Thank you for your interest! 😇
